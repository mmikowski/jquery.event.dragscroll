# jquery.event.dragscroll
## Use libraries, not frameworks
This is a library that strives to be best-in-class.
If you are considering using an SPA framework, please read [Do you
really want an SPA framework?][0] first.

## Summary
Use this jQuery plugin to create numerous inertia scrolling areas all 
with their own properties.  One does this by creating a drag-scroll-handler
object and then using the event handlers and methods from that object.

This plugin is an extension of those featured in the
book **Single Page Web Applications - JavaScript end-to-end**
which is available from [Amazon][1] and directly from [Manning][2].
and passes JSLint.  It is touch and desktop enabled.

Compatible with jQuery 1.7.0+.

## Browser Support
Works with iOS5+ (Stock browser) and Android 3.2+ (Chrome) and of course
all modern desktop browsers (IE9+ and later version of
Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.

IE9 may require edge settings in the **head** section:

      <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />

## Examples
